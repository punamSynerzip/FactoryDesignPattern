# FactoryDesignPattern
Factory design pattern sample example in java


Problem: 
	When class doesn't know what subclasses required to create.

Solution: 
	Factory design pattern is the best solution.

	We just need to define an interface or abstract class for creating an object, let the subclasses decide which class to instantiate.

Advantage:
	Can achieve loose coupling
	Subclass can choose the type of object they want to create.
